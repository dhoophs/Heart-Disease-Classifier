# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Abstract 

Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a potent tool in the realm of healthcare, particularly in the prediction and diagnosis of diseases. This paper focuses on the application of ML in predicting heart disease, a significant global health concern. By leveraging various ML algorithms on a dataset of patient information, we aim to develop an efficient model for early detection and risk assessment of heart disease.

Introduction
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, emphasizing the critical need for accurate and timely prediction methods. Traditional risk assessment tools often lack precision and can overlook subtle patterns in patient data. Machine Learning (ML) offers a promising solution by analyzing vast datasets to uncover intricate relationships, enabling better prediction and prevention strategies.
