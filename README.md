# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Abstract 

Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a potent tool in the realm of healthcare, particularly in the prediction and diagnosis of diseases. This paper focuses on the application of ML in predicting heart disease, a significant global health concern. By leveraging various ML algorithms on a dataset of patient information, we aim to develop an efficient model for early detection and risk assessment of heart disease.

Introduction

Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, emphasizing the critical need for accurate and timely prediction methods. Traditional risk assessment tools often lack precision and can overlook subtle patterns in patient data. Machine Learning (ML) offers a promising solution by analyzing vast datasets to uncover intricate relationships, enabling better prediction and prevention strategies.

Brief Discription

The dataset used in this study comprises a comprehensive range of patient attributes such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. Through the lens of ML, these features serve as valuable inputs for training models to predict the likelihood of heart disease occurrence. Various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K Nearest Neighbours (kNN) and Neural Networks, are employed to create robust prediction models.
