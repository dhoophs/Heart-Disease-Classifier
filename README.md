# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Abstract
Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a potent tool in the realm of healthcare, particularly in the prediction and diagnosis of diseases. This paper focuses on the application of ML in predicting heart disease, a significant global health concern. By leveraging various ML algorithms on a dataset of patient information, we aim to develop an efficient model for early detection and risk assessment of heart disease.
